# LP
class.user.php for all classes
Member.php for form classes
profiles.php for html code for form


Database is included and needed to create/login users.


In database there is are 2 tables: 
 - Users which have the information when one create and login ( fname, lname & email )
 - members who have the data for fname, lname, email, address, zip, city, phone etc.

Need Full validation made for create & form in php
cleaning code

the form needs to work so, the user can add/edit the form + a profile image need to be added.
Right now everytime i fill the form it will add a new row instead of updating the row.
also the form needs to save the data so it seens whats already written.
